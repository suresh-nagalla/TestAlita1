  Scenario Outline: Successful addition of a new pet
    Given I have the details of the pet "<Id>","<Name>","<Status>"
    When I send a POST request to the "pet" endpoint with the pet's details in JSON format
    Then the pet should be added to the store's inventory

    Examples:
      | Id  | Name   | Status    |

      | 200 | Tommy200 | available |

 Scenario Outline: Verify that a pet can be retrieved by its ID
   Given I have the details of the pet "<Id>","<Name>","<Status>" exists
   When I send a POST request to the "pet" endpoint with the pet's details in JSON format
   When User retrieves the pet details with ID "<Id>"
   Then The API should return a 200 OK response with the pet object that matches the "<Id>","<Name>","<Status>" 

     Examples:
